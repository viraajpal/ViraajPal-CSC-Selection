"Country State and City Selection" I've crafted a concise layout with dynamic dropdowns. After choosing a country, subsequent dropdowns adjust their options. For instance, selecting "India" shows its states. Further, the city dropdown adapts to the chosen state. This logic extends to all countries, enhancing user relevance.
